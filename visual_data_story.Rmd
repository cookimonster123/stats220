## What's going on with this data?
This analysis explores patterns in chess gameplays, specifically using attributes such as move counts, results, and  duration, etc. Through visualizations, we examine the relationships between different aspects of chess gameplay.\

## Game Outcomes and Number of Moves
The first plot examines whether the number of moves in a chess game is associated with the game’s outcome. Games are categorized into five move-count ranges: under 10, 10–19, 20–29, 30–39, and over 40 moves. The distribution shows that most games fall within the 20–29 move range, which also appears to correspond with a higher frequency of wins. Although this plot presents raw counts rather than proportions, it still provides insight into the overall distribution of outcomes across different game lengths. \

## Duration and Move Count
In the second plot, we explore whether the time duration of games affects the number of moves. We categorized games into four groups based on duration, less than 1 minute, 1-10, 10-20 and longer than 20 minutes. Then, we overlaid the number of moves with jitters and boxplots. 
From the plot we can see than we indeed have a higher move count as the duration increases.

## Time of Day and Game Frequency
Finally, we used the timestamp to investigate when games are played the most frequently. We categorised the games into Morning (5am to 12pm), Afternoon(12pm - 6pm), Night(6pm-5am).

The results show that afternoon and night dominate game activity, and morning has the fewest games.\
